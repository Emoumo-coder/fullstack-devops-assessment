## Frontend Features

### Implemented Features
- **User Authentication** - Secure login/registration with JWT
- **Form Management** - Create, view, and manage forms
- **Drag & Drop Interface** - Intuitive form building experience
- **Section & Group Management** - Organize form elements logically
- **Multiple Field Types**:
  - Text inputs (Name, Email, etc.)
  - Radio buttons (Yes/No options)
  - Checkboxes (Multiple selections)
  - File upload with drag-and-drop
  - Date pickers
  - Select dropdowns

### User Workflow
1. **Authenticate** - Login to access form builder
2. **Create Form** - Add sections and groups
3. **Drag & Drop** - Add form elements from sidebar
4. **Save & Preview** - Persist forms and preview functionality

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for predictable state
- **Styling**: SCSS with Ant Design components
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit for modern, accessible interactions
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 with RESTful API design
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum for API tokens
- **Database**: MySQL with JSON column for form structure

### Key Technical Choices
1. **Component-Based Architecture** - Reusable, maintainable components
2. **Containerized Deployment** - Consistent environments with Docker
3. **JSON Form Storage** - Flexible form structure in database
4. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with Ant Design
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive client and server-side validation

## Deployment

### Platform: Railway.app
**Why Railway**:
- Docker-native platform perfect for multi-service applications
- Free tier with 500 hours/month + $5 credit
- Automatic HTTPS and database provisioning
- Easy GitHub integration with auto-deploys

### Deployment Steps
1. **Connect Repository** - Link GitHub repo to Railway
2. **Auto-Detection** - Railway detects docker-compose.yml
3. **Environment Setup** - Automatic database and environment variables
4. **Live Deployment** - Application deployed with public URL

### Environment Variables
```env
# Backend
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=[auto-provided]
DB_DATABASE=[auto-provided]
DB_USERNAME=[auto-provided]
DB_PASSWORD=[auto-provided]

# Frontend
VITE_API_URL=[railway-backend-url]/api
```

## Implementation Status

### Completed (Must Have)
- [x] User authentication (login/register)
- [x] Create and save forms
- [x] Retrieve saved forms
- [x] Basic form structure (sections ‚Üí groups ‚Üí fields)
- [x] Drag and drop for multiple field types
- [x] Docker setup with docker-compose
- [x] Live deployment with persistent database

### Additional Features Implemented
- [x] Form preview functionality
- [x] Real-time form editing
- [x] Field validation and error handling
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Professional UI/UX with Ant Design

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Design Decisions

### Strategic Design Choices
**Note on Figma Implementation**: I deliberately chose not to implement pixel-perfect Figma matching to demonstrate core functionality and technical capabilities within the time constraints. The focus was on building a robust, functional form builder with proper architecture rather than exact visual replication.

### Current Scope Limitations
1. **No Form Deletion** - Forms can be created but not deleted in UI (backend API supports deletion)
2. **Limited Field Validation** - Basic validation implemented; advanced validation scenarios not covered
3. **No Undo/Redo** - Advanced editing features intentionally excluded to focus on core functionality
4. **Basic Error Handling** - Comprehensive error scenarios not fully covered; core error handling implemented

### Technical Constraints
- Free tier hosting limitations (memory/CPU constraints)
- No advanced form analytics or reporting
- Limited file upload size based on hosting platform
- Simplified state management for rapid development

## Time Spent
- **Total Development Time**: ~35 hours
- **Frontend**: 20 hours
- **Backend**: 10 hours  
- **DevOps & Deployment**: 5 hours

## Trade-offs & Simplifications

### Made for Time Constraints
1. **Separate Services** - Deployed frontend, backend, and database as separate Railway services for reliability
2. **Basic CI/CD** - Manual deployment instead of full GitHub Actions pipeline
3. **Simplified State** - Used Redux Toolkit instead of more complex state solutions
4. **Standard Components** - Leveraged Ant Design for rapid UI development
5. **Functional Over Visual** - Prioritized working functionality over pixel-perfect Figma matching

### Focus Areas
- Core form builder functionality
- Reliable authentication system
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Production-ready deployment
- API design and documentation

## Development Commands

### Backend (Laravel)
```bash
cd backend
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

### Frontend (React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Docker
```bash
# Development
docker-compose up -d

# Production build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
